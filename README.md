## Abstract

base-ui is a design system aimed at enabling faster development of front-end applications by providing a collection of ready-to-use features typically required by the majority of projects. Additionally, it provides a foundational structure for all the products using the system, making it easier for developers and designers to collaborate. The main requirements covered by the base-ui design system are: markup structure, styles management, and a set of components that address the common needs of any modern web application.
